///				The currency on the left is called the base currency 
///				currency on the right is called the counter currency. 
///		-- Almost all currency pairs are quoted to four decimal places, except when the Japanese yen appears in the counter currency.
///			 In such cases, the forex quote is displayed in two decimal places.
///		-- A pip is the smallest price movement in a currency pair.
///			If the EUR/USD moves up from 1.3435 to 1.3436, this movement is called 1 pip.

/// WHAT CAUSES THE PRICE OF CURRENCIES TO FLUCTUATE?
/// Economic Factors
///		1. Growth : When growth is negative, the value of the country’s currency tends to fall. 
///			This is because the currency is not viewed as attractive or valuable, and traders start selling it.
///			when growth is positive, the value of the country’s currency tends to rise. This is because more traders end up buying the currency
///		2. CONSUMER SPENDING : When consumer spending increases, the general health of the economy increases, and subsequent demand 
///			for the country’s currency increases and vice versa.
///		3. Continuous records of current account deficits may lead to a natural depreciation of a country’s currency. 
///			This is because money for trade, income, and aid is leaving the country to make payments in a foreign currency
/// Political Factors
///		1.  upcoming election :political instability and uncertainty (currency volatilty)
/// Natural Disasters
///		1. earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods
